Some projects that I have worked on

Boid_GUI (Java): A predator-prey simulation with changeable factors. Uses complex vector geometry. Fun to play around with!

FPA (Java): Uses "Rotating Calipers" algorithm to efficiently find the farthest two points in a point cloud. Red line denotes distance

GameOfLife (Java): Inspired by "Conway's Game of Life" (search this up). Contains two separate programs:
       1. GOL2: My better version of Conway's Game of Life
       2. LawnSim: Simulates the takeover of a grassy lawn by dandelions. Frustrated farmer burns the lawn in the end. Fun to watch!
